# Sebastes_test_data
This repository contian methylation statistics and data for Sebastes alutus: ABLG-47592. the DNA sample (125 ng/ul) was procesed with NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq v2 (E8015G) sample kit. Sample was ligated with adaptor1=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA, adaptor2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT and index 1 CACTGTAG, forward: AAGCGACT reverse: AGTCGCTT. Alignement for this sample was done using bwa-meth and methylation level using MetylDakel. This pilot data was processed https://usegalaxy.org/u/adrian_reich/h/nebnext-emseqv2rawdata  which is also avalable on Github: https://github.com/nebiolabs/EM-seq/.
